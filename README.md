### About Me

3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Kadir Has University (full scholarship, English-medium), with a minor in Digital Game Design. I enjoy building things across the stack — from logic circuits and FSM controllers to JavaFX desktop apps and Unity games. Currently serving as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the Computer Organization and Architecture course, mentoring 107 students.

I take ownership of what I build, work well in teams, and I'm always looking to grow.
